## Extra-Curricular Endeavors

### Built The IISER M App for Android and PC - 2019
  - I created a majority of the Unofficial IISER-M App for [Android](https://github.com/DhruvaSambrani/IISER-Android). A [PC version](https://github.com/DhruvaSambrani/IISERM_pc) of the same is also underway.

### Contributed in building the Pakshi Birding App
  - I contributed in making the Pakshi Birding App under [Dr. Manjari Jain](https://manjarijain.net/)'s [Behavior and Ecology Lab, IISER M](). Pakshi is an app developed  to assist both budding and experienced birders.

### Teaching underprivileged Children as part of RTE Act - 2016
  - As a way to give back to the community, I taught underprivileged children English and Mathematics for two weeks in my school in 2016. The group involved two children, both of whom had learning disorders.

### Knowledge of Multiple Coding Languages
  - I know C++ and actively code in Python, Java (Android). I also am presently learning Julia for Scientific Computing. Please visit [my GitHub account](https://github.com/DhruvaSambrani/repo).

## Research Experience

### [Linear Algebra of Quantum Mechanics and the simulation of a Quantum Computer](../papers/qc.pdf) \| [Arvind](http://14.139.227.202/Faculty/arvind/) \| Summer 2019
  - This was an introductory reading to the Mathematical Structures that underlie Quantum Mechanics and then take it forward to a theoretical introduction to Quantum Information and Quantum Computing. I also attempt to simulate a Quantum Computer on a Classical computer and making a [Julia module](https://github.com/DhruvaSambrani/Quantum-Computing) for the same. This paper serves as a very brief introduction to Quantum Computing and documentation of the code in the form while publishing.

### [Black body radiation in special relativistic frames](../papers/bbr_vel_trans.pdf) \| [JS Bagla](http://14.139.227.202/Faculty/jasjeet/index.html) \| Winter 2018

  - As part of my 2018 winter project, I took up a project in Special Relativity under JS Bagla, wherein I looked at how Black Body Radiation transforms in a frame that is moving uniformly with respect to the source. We see that the radiation is no more uniform, leading to a force on the particle. The [quantitative analysis](../papers/bbr_f_on_particle.pdf) of this force is done using numerical methods in Julia.

### [Earthian awards ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8vd4YD-FkfkUmZhUVUwQU53NzdORGpneTlQbE5kaEhNYlRj/view?usp=sharing)\| Wipro-Prakriya \| Sept-Dec 2014

  - Wipro LTD. organizes “[The Earthian Awards](http://wiprofoundation.org/earthian)” as part of their CSR initiative which involves teams from schools and colleges submitting a research report on the broad topic of the year. Our report dealt with the lakes of Bengaluru and how rapid industrialization and urbanization, coupled with unempathetic public policies, have led to declining quality and quantity of the natural resource.
