We see that for numerical examples, the convergence rate is faster and much closer to the reset location than in stochastic resetting. We want to extend this faster convergence to potentially speed up Quantum Walks [ISBN:978-3-319-97812-3], speeding up multiple algorithms which depend on Quantum Walks. Further, stochastic resetting can also model certain biological and economical processes which may be better explained by Quantum Resetting."
