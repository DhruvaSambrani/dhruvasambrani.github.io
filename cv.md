# Research and Work Experience - Discovering the World


### Quantum Intern | BQP | Summer 2022

Interned at BosonQ Psi in the Quantum team where I proposed and built methods to solve problems of interest as part of a multiskilled team. Projects I was involved in were related to Feynman-Kac equation, Quantum Monte Carlo methods and Complexity analysis.

### Superpositioned Grover's Algorithm | MN Bera | Summer 2022

In a similar vein to Quantum Resetting, this is an ongoing project to speed up the Grover\'s Search problem by applying a superposition of the Oracle and the Unitary.

### Quantum Resetting of Quantum Systems | MN Bera | Summer 2021-22

An ongoing project building on multiple works on Stochastic Resetting of Classical Systems \[arXiv:2107.11686\] and on Quantum Systems \[arXiv:2008.00510.pdf; Phys. Rev. B 98, 104309\], and extending Anubhav Srivastava\'s Master\'s Thesis \[2021, IISER Mohali\], we apply a superposition of the evolve and the reset mechanisms and explore the resulting dynamics of the system. We see that for numerical examples, the convergence rate is faster and much closer to the reset location than in stochastic resetting. We want to extend this faster convergence to potentially speed up Quantum Walks \[ISBN:978-3-319-97812-3\], speeding up multiple algorithms which depend on Quantum Walks. Further, stochastic resetting can also model certain biological and economical processes which may be better explained by Quantum Resetting.

### RLNN for Quantum Multiple Hypothesis Testing | Sarah Brandsen | Summer 2020

Optimized certain parts of the code for the algorithm suggested in the paper. Project stopped due to non-continuation of project from guide.

### Ordering Channels | Sarah Brandsen | Winter 2020

An attempt to partial ordering of quantum channels by concepts of Data Driven Inferences. We define an order over the set of positive, trace preserving maps on the existence of another map which when applied would lead to equivalence. Based on Buschemi et. al. \[New J. Phys. 21 113029\] and Dall\'Arno et. al. \[Proc. R. Soc. A.47320160721\].

### Introduction to Quantum Mechanics and Computing | Arvind | Summer 2019

My First Year Summer Project was an introductory reading to the Mathematical Structures that underlie Quantum Mechanics and then take it forward to a theoretical introduction to Quantum Information and Quantum Computing. I also attempt to simulate a Quantum Computer on a Classical computer and making a [Julia module](https://github.com/DhruvaSambrani/Quantum-Computing) for the same. [This paper](https://dhruvasambrani.github.io/papers/qc.pdf) serves as a very brief introduction to Quantum Computing and documentation of the code in the form while publishing.

### Relativistic Black Body Radiation | JS Bagla | Winter 2018

As part of my First Year Winter Project, I took up the project [Black body radiation in special relativistic frames](https://dhruvasambrani.github.io/papers/bbr_vel_trans.pdf) under [JS Bagla, IISER Mohali](http://14.139.227.202/Faculty/jasjeet/index.html), where I looked at how Black Body Radiation transforms in a frame that is moving uniformly with respect to the source. We see that the radiation is no more uniform, leading to a force on the particle. The [quantitative analysis](https://dhruvasambrani.github.io/papers/bbr_f_on_particle.pdf) of this force is done using numerical methods in Julia.
