# Programming - Reinventing The World


### IISER-M App | Android | Firebase

I started making the [Unofficial IISER-M app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dhruva.iiser) for Android in the Summer of 2019. With 200+ downloads, it remains in constant development with new features being added every 6 Months

### IISER-M PC | HTML-CSS-JS | electron

A [PC version](https://github.com/DhruvaSambrani/IISERM_pc) of the Unofficial IISER App is in the making, to facilitate easy usage of institute resources

### QuantumComputing.jl | Julia

An attempt to simulate a Quantum Computer and making a [Julia module](https://github.com/DhruvaSambrani/QuantumComputing.jl) for the same. [The associated paper](https://dhruvasambrani.github.io/papers/qc.pdf) also acts as the documentation

### Simulation and Modelling | Python | Coursera

Completed the course [Simulation and modeling of natural processes](https://www.coursera.org/learn/modeling-simulation-natural-processes) offered by Geneva University. Received [Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/records/PH29Z7XD65XW) with a grade of 95.31%

### Discrete Math for CS (Specialization) | Python | Coursera

Completed the Specialization [Introduction to Discrete Mathematics for Computer Science](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/discrete-mathematics) offered by National Research University Higher School of Economics & University of California San Diego. See [Certification](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/H6UDQ3KSJPJ7)\
Courses Completed:\
Mathematical Thinking in Computer Science\
Introduction to Graph Theory\
Combinatorics and Probability\
Delivery Problem\
Number Theory and Cryptography

### Minivet Birding App | Android | SQL

I [contributed](http://manjarijain.net/Minivet.html) in making the [Minivet Birding App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.manjarijain.minivet) under [Dr. Manjari Jain](https://manjarijain.net/)\'s Behavior and Ecology Lab, IISER-M. Minivet is an app developed to assist both budding and experienced birders.

### ArcheoSiteNamer | Python | SQL

[ArcheoSiteNamer](https://github.com/DhruvaSambrani/ArcheoSiteNamer) is a novel method of naming Archeological Sites. Without a standard naming convention, archeological site names often collide with each other. Hence, with [Parth Chauhan\'s Lab](https://www.researchgate.net/lab/IISERM-Palaeoanthropology-and-Archaeology-Lab-Parth-R-Chauhan), I created a DBMS to facilitate easy adoption of the proposed convention.

### ASN-GUI | electron | SQL

[ArcheoSiteNamer GUI](https://github.com/DhruvaSambrani/ArcheoSiteNamer_GUI) is a GUI application which uses the ASN Python backend to make and maintain databases of sites.

### Functional Programming | Scala | Coursera

Completed the course [Functional Programming Principles in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1) offered by Geneva University. Received [Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/records/ZLFHP74QQ86H) with a grade of 96.00%

### Github Profile | Multiple Languages

Do visit my GitHub profile to see my other projects in a multitude of languages and fields! Link at the bottom of the page

# Research Experience - Discovering the World


### Relativistic Black Body Radiation | JS Bagla | Winter 2018

As part of my First Year Winter Project, I took up the project [Black body radiation in special relativistic frames](https://dhruvasambrani.github.io/papers/bbr_vel_trans.pdf) under [JS Bagla, IISER Mohali](http://14.139.227.202/Faculty/jasjeet/index.html), where I looked at how Black Body Radiation transforms in a frame that is moving uniformly with respect to the source. We see that the radiation is no more uniform, leading to a force on the particle. The [quantitative analysis](https://dhruvasambrani.github.io/papers/bbr_f_on_particle.pdf) of this force is done using numerical methods in Julia.

### Introduction to Quantum Mechanics and Computing | Arvind | Summer 2019

My First Year Summer Project was an introductory reading to the Mathematical Structures that underlie Quantum Mechanics and then take it forward to a theoretical introduction to Quantum Information and Quantum Computing. I also attempt to simulate a Quantum Computer on a Classical computer and making a [Julia module](https://github.com/DhruvaSambrani/Quantum-Computing) for the same. [This paper](https://dhruvasambrani.github.io/papers/qc.pdf) serves as a very brief introduction to Quantum Computing and documentation of the code in the form while publishing.
