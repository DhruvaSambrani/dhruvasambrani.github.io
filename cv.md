# Research and Work Experience - Discovering the World


### Quantum Intern | BQP | May-Nov 2022

Interned at BosonQ Psi in the Quantum team where I proposed and built methods to solve problems of interest as part of a multiskilled team. Projects I was involved in were related to Feynman-Kac equation, Quantum Monte Carlo methods and Complexity analysis. Initially 3 month internship extended to 5 months

### Quantum Walks and Resetting | MN Bera | Master Thesis, Aug 2022-May 2023

After studying about quantum walks and search algorithms, I reformulated quantum resetting for walks. We apply a superposition of the evolve and the reset mechanisms and explore the resulting dynamics of the system. Primarily, we are interested in increase mean first hit time, speeding up related algorithms which depend on Quantum Walks.

### Quantum Resetting of Quantum Systems | MN Bera | May-July 2021

Building on multiple works on Stochastic Resetting of Classical Systems and on Quantum Systems, and implementing a novel quantum resetting. We explored the dynamics, dependance on initial conditions, and time to steady state.

### RLNN for Quantum Multiple Hypothesis Testing | Sarah Brandsen | Oct-Nov 2020

Studied RLNN is used for Quantum Multiple Hypothesis Testing. Project involved learning about RLNN and I helped optimize certain parts of the code for the suggested algorithm.

### Ordering Channels | Sarah Brandsen | Dec 2020-Jan 2021

An attempt to partial ordering of quantum channels by concepts of Data Driven Inferences. We define an order over the set of positive, trace preserving maps on the existence of another map which when applied would lead to equivalence. Based on Buschemi et. al. and Dall\'Arno et. al.

### Introduction to Quantum Mechanics and Computing | Arvind | May-July 2019

Studied Mathematical Structures that underlie Quantum Mechanics and a theoretical introduction to QCQI. Also attempted to simulate a Quantum Computer on a Classical computer and making a [Julia module](https://github.com/DhruvaSambrani/Quantum-Computing) for the same. [Report](https://dhruvasambrani.github.io/papers/qc.pdf) also serves as documentation of the code in the form while publishing.

### Relativistic Black Body Radiation | JS Bagla | Dec 2018

I studied [Black body radiation in special relativistic frames](https://dhruvasambrani.github.io/papers/bbr_vel_trans.pdf) under [JS Bagla, IISER Mohali](http://14.139.227.202/Faculty/jasjeet/index.html), where I looked at how Black Body Radiation transforms in a frame that is moving uniformly with respect to the source. The [quantitative analysis](https://dhruvasambrani.github.io/papers/bbr_f_on_particle.pdf) of the force due to non uniform radiation is done using numerical methods in Julia.

# Programming - Reinventing The World



### Modelling Complex Systems | Julia | 2021

As part of a course, I have learnt multiple models often used in the field and explored quite a bit in the following [repository](https://dhruvasambrani.github.io/idc621)

### QuantumComputing.jl | Julia | Package

An attempt to simulate a Quantum Computer and making a [Julia module](https://github.com/DhruvaSambrani/QuantumComputing.jl) for the same. [The associated paper](https://dhruvasambrani.github.io/papers/qc.pdf) also acts as the documentation


### Coursera Courses | Python | Coursera
